1. Introduction
Welcome to CaraVan ("the App"), a social and dating application designed for the van-life and nomadic community. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Android application.

Please read this policy carefully. By using CaraVan, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

2. Information We Collect
a. Information You Provide Directly
Account Information: When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, date of birth, gender identity, and a profile photo.

Profile Details: Information you choose to share in your profile, such as your van type, travel lifestyle, interests, relationship preferences, biography, and current/past locations.

User Content: Photos, posts, messages, chats, and other content you generate within the App.

Communications: Any information you provide when contacting customer support or communicating with other users.

b. Information Collected Automatically
Location Data: Precise GPS-based location (with your explicit permission) to show your approximate location to other users and suggest potential matches nearby. You can control location sharing in your device or App settings.

Usage Data: Information about your interactions with the App, such as features you use, time spent, pages viewed, and your interactions with other users (likes, matches, etc.).

Device Information: Your device type, operating system, unique device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID), IP address, mobile network information, and app crash logs.

c. Information from Third Parties
We may receive information from third-party services if you link your CaraVan account (e.g., Instagram, Spotify). The information we receive depends on that service's policies and your privacy settings there.

3. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected information to:

Provide, maintain, and improve the App's core functionality (matching, social features, communication).

Personalize your experience, including suggesting matches and content.

Facilitate connections and communication between users.

Ensure safety and security, including investigating suspicious activity or policy violations.

Send you administrative messages, service updates, security alerts, and support communications.

Analyze usage trends to improve the App and develop new features.

Comply with legal obligations.

4. How We Share Your Information
We do not sell your personal data. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:

With Other Users: Your profile information and content you post publicly are visible to other users as intended by the App's features. Your approximate location (e.g., "within 50 miles") may be shown to potential matches.

Service Providers: We share data with trusted third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting, data analysis, customer support, payment processing).

Legal Requirements: We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of CaraVan, our users, or others.

Business Transfers: In connection with a merger, sale, or acquisition of all or part of our business.

With Your Consent: We may share information for any other purpose disclosed to you with your consent.

5. Your Choices and Controls
Profile Visibility: You can control what information is public in your profile settings.

Location Sharing: You can enable or disable location services via your device settings. Disabling may limit key App features.

Push Notifications: You can manage push notifications through your device settings.

Account Deletion: You can permanently delete your account and associated data within the App's settings. This action is irreversible.

Access and Correction: You can review and update most of your personal information directly in your profile.

6. Safety and Community Guidelines
CaraVan is built for a nomadic community. We encourage users to:

Be respectful and authentic.

Never share sensitive personal information (home address, financial details) with other users.

Use the in-app reporting tools to report suspicious or inappropriate behavior.

Exercise caution when deciding to meet someone in person. Meet in public places and inform a friend of your plans.

7. Data Security
We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your personal information. However, no electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

8. Data Retention
We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Upon account deletion, we will delete or anonymize your data as described, except where retention is necessary for legal reasons.

9. International Data Transfers
Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

10. Children's Privacy
CaraVan is intended for users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we learn we have collected such data, we will delete it promptly.

11. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the new policy in the App and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.
